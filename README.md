Live data is fetched from Open Library:

-   Trending: `https://openlibrary.org/trending/daily.json`
-   Subject search: `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?subject={subject}&limit={value}`
-   General search: `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q={query}&limit={value}`
-   Covers: `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{coverId}-L.jpg`
-   Work details: `https://openlibrary.org{workKey}.json`

## Features

## Project structure

```
src/
  App.jsx                # Routes: Home, Trending, Browse, Random, About
  main.jsx               # Theme (dark), Router, app bootstrap
  components/
	 AppBar.jsx           # Top navigation with mobile drawer
	 CardList.jsx         # Fetches and renders books (trending/subject/search)

	 CardView.jsx         # Backdrop dialog with details and Read more
  pages/
	 Home.jsx             # Landing hero
	 Trending.jsx         # Trending + curated subjects
	 Browse.jsx           # Search flow with skeletons and empty state

```

## Conventions

-   React best practices: component reuse (CardList/Card/CardView), minimal local state, hooks-driven effects
-   Separation of concerns: pages for screens, components for shared UI
-   DRY API integration: CardList handles trending/subject/search in one place
-   UX polish: Skeletons, spinners, Backdrop dialog, smooth transitions

## Notes

-   This is a client-side app; API calls go directly to Open Library. Rate limits/errors are handled with loading states and friendly messages.
-   Cover images may be missing for some works; a placeholder image is shown.
